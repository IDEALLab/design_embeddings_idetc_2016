Experiment code associated with our IDETC 2016 paper: "How Designs Differ: Non-Linear Embeddings Illuminate Intrinsic Design Complexity"

Our more recent work is here: https://github.com/IDEALLab/design_embeddings_jmd_2016

To prepare the parametric space for hyperparameter optimization: python parametric_space.py

To train a model using optimized hyperparameters and evaluate with testing samples: python training.py

Edit parameters in config.ini

The settings of the kernel PCA and autoencoders are in the configuration files in './hp-opt'

The configuration files are named 'hp\_\<example\>\_\<sample size\>\_\<semantic space dimensionality\>\_\<indices of testing samples\>.ini'

We used [Spearmint](https://github.com/HIPS/Spearmint) for hyperparameter optimization of kernel PCA and autoencoders
